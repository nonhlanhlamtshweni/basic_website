Tswaing, which means “place of salt” in Setswana, is the site where a meteorite half a football field in size slammed into the Earth 220 000 years ago, forming a crater 1.4km in diameter and 200m deep. This crater, formerly known as the Pretoria Saltpan (or Soutpan), is one of about 170 impact craters in the world and one of four known impact craters in South Africa. It's one of the invariable tourist attractions in South Africa.</p>

                <p>Within the Sterkfontein Caves, scientists have discovered many hominid and other animal fossils, dating back more than 4-million years, to the birth of humanity. The most important and most famous of these fossils are “Mrs Ples”, a 2.1-million-year-old Australopithecus skull, and “Little Foot”, an almost complete Australopithecus skeleton that is more than 3-million years old. These fossils, both found in the Sterkfontein Caves in the Cradle of Humankind, tell us much about the precursors of modern humans, Homo sapiens. </p>

                <p>The Credo Mutwa cultural village is more than a museum, it is an outdoor experience steeped in tradition and African folklore. It is comprised of sculpture and buildings created by the African artist Credo Mutwa. Mutwa was also a traditional healer said to have the powers to predict the future, depicted in his statues believed to depict the AIDs epidemic. The village is located in the heart of  and underwent a restoration project in 2006. A visit to the village is a journey through the life of this intriguing sangoma and his work in conservation, an exhibition of the role traditional African culture plays within the urban environment. Mutwa’s garden is the product of his vision to enlighten Africans about the folklore of the land and to protect African heritage, teaching Africans how to believe in their own greatness. He abandoned the project in 1986, leaving everything to fall into a tragic state of disrepair.
                    In 2006, a restoration project was undertaken under the guidance of Musa Ntanzi, a student of Mutwa. Although renovated, the village remains in a dilapidated state – but still worth a visit.</p>
